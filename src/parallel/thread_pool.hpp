 * task joining capability.

 * The parallel_task_queue also provides exception forwarding.
 * exception throws within a thread of type const char* will be caught
 * and forwarded to the join() function.
 * If the call to join() is wrapped by a try-catch block, the exception
 * will be caught safely and thread cleanup will be completed properly.

 * queue.launch(...)

 * queue.join()
