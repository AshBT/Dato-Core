  \ingroup httpserver
  \brief This is used to map a URL on the mtrics server 
             to a processing function.
  
  The processing function must have the prototype
  \code
  std::pair<std::string, std::string> callback(std::map<std::string, std::string>&)
  \endcode

  The processing function takes a map of GET variables to their corresponding
  values, and returns a pair of strings. (content_type, content)
  \li \c content type is the http content_type header. For instance text/plain
     or text/html.
  \li \c content is the actual body

  For instance: The builtin 404 handler looks like this:

  \code
  std::pair<std::string, std::string> 
  four_oh_four(std::map<std::string, std::string>& varmap) {
    return std::make_pair(std::string("text/html"), 
                        std::string("Page Not Found"));
  }
  \endcode

  \note The callbacks are only processed on machine 0 since only machine 0
  launches the server.

  \param page The page to map. For instance <code>page = "a.html"</code>
              will be shown on http://[server]/a.html
  \param callback The callback function to use to process the page
