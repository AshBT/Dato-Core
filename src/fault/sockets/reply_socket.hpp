 *
 * This object works together with the socket_receive_pollset().
 * The general construction is to
 *  - Create a reply_socket
 *  - Create a socket_receive_pollset
 *  - Register the keys this socket should listen on (register_key() )
 *  - register this reply_socket with the pollset
 *    (add_to_pollset())
 *  - start the pollset ( socket_receive_pollset::start_poll_thread() )
 *
 * \note
 * if zookeeper is enabled, The first part of the message must be a key. 
 * This must be a key the current client is registered for.
