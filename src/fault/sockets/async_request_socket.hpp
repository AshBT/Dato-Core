/**
 * \ingroup fault
 * Constructs a zookeeper backed asynchronous request socket.
 * Will automatically retry sockets.
 * This object is multi-threaded. Calls can be made from any thread.
 *
 * \note
 * The design is to use DEALER sockets to communicate with the REP sockets
 * on the other side. However, background sends are an issue because zeromq
 * does not let me do sends and receives in seperate threads.
 * The solution is to create 3 sockets.
 *  - A DEALER socket to talk to the REP socket remotely.
 *    This can then be attached to the pollset and callbacks will then set the
 *    future.
 *  - An inproc PULL socket also attached to the pollset. Messages received
 *    on the PULL socket are forwarded out the DEALER socket.
 *  - An inproc PUSH socket to send stuff to the PULL socket.
 *
 *  An issue is the retries are somewhat tricky to manage. So unlike the
 *  synchronous request_socket, this socket does not do retries. Any failure
 *  will return a status in the future, and it is up to the client to perform
 *  the retry.
