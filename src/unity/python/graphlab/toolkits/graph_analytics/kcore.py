    A KcoreModel object contains a core ID for each vertex, and the total
    number of cores in the graph.

    The core ID of a vertex is a measure of its global centrality.

    The algorithms iteratively remove vertices that has less than :math:`k`
    neighbors **recursively**. The algorithm guarantees that at iteration
    :math:`k+1`, all vertices left in the graph will have at least :math:`k+1`
    neighbors.  The vertices removed at iteration :math:`k` is assigned with a
    core ID equal to :math:`k`.

    Below is a list of queryable fields for this model:

    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | Field         | Description                                        |
    +===============+====================================================+
    | core_id       | An SFrame with each vertex's core id               |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | graph         | A new SGraph with the core id as a vertex property |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | kmax          | The maximun core id assigned to any vertex         |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | kmin          | The minimun core id assigned to any vertex         |

    | training_time | Total training time of the model                   |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+

    This model cannot be constructed directly.  Instead, use
    :func:`graphlab.kcore.create` to create an instance
    of this model. A detailed list of parameter options and code samples
    are available in the documentation for the create function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : SGraph
        The graph on which to compute the k-core decomposition.

    kmin : int, optional
        Minimun core id. Vertices having smaller core id than `kmin` will be
        assigned with core_id = `kmin`.

        Maximun core id. Vertices having larger core id than `kmax` will be

    Examples
    --------
    If given an :class:`~graphlab.SGraph` ``g``, we can create
    a :class:`~graphlab.kcore.KcoreModel` as follows:

    >>> g = graphlab.load_graph('http://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.txt.gz', format='snap')
    >>> kc = graphlab.kcore.create(g)

    We can obtain the ``core id`` corresponding to each vertex in the graph
    ``g`` using:

    >>> kcore_id = kc['core_id']     # SFrame

    We can add the new core id field to the original graph g using:

    >>> g.vertices['core_id'] = kc['graph'].vertices['core_id']

    Note that the task above does not require a join because the vertex
    ordering is preserved through ``create()``.
