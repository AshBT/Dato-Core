 * This is a standard algorithm for sampling from probability mass functions.
 * It is also known as the Walker Method.
 * Typically sampling from general discrete functions requires the inverse CDF 
 * method, which means each sample is O(K) where K is the number of outcomes in
 * the pmf. The alias method, on the other hand, requires O(K) setup but requires
 * only O(1) for each sample. To be specific, each sample only requires a 
 * uniformly generated float and a uniformly generated integer.
 *
 * For more details, see
