/**

 * The base interface type SIterable<T> conceptually provide a simple,
 * minimal parallel InputIterator concept.
 *
 * The SIterable manages the entire collection of parallel iterators within
 * one object for simplicity.  Conceptually, the SIterable defines a sequence
 * of objects of type T which is cut into a collection of segments (#segments
 * returned by num_segments). You can get iterator of the segment via
 * (begin(segmentid), and end(segmentid)), Basically, parallel iteration can
 * be written as:
 * \code
 *  #pragma omp parallel for
 *  for (int s = 0; s < sarray.num_segments(); ++s) {
 *    auto iter = sarray.begin(s);
 *    auto end = sarray.end(s);
 *     while(iter != end) {
 *       ...
 *       ++iter;
 *     }
 *  }
 * \endcode
