/**
 * Provides block reading capability in v2 segment files.
 *
 * This class manages block reading of an SArray/SArray group , and provides
 * functions to query the blocks (such has how many blocks are there in the
 * segment, and how many rows are there in the block etc).
 *
 * Array Group 
 * -----------
 * An array group is a collection of segment files which contain and represent
 * and collection of arrays (columns).
 *
 * Essentially an Array Group comprises of the following:
 * - group.sidx 
 *     the group index file. A JSON serialized contents of 
 *     group_index_file_information. Describes a collection of arrays.
 * - group.0000, group.0001, group.0002
 *     Each file is one segment of the array group. (multiple segments in an
 *     array group really exist only for parallel writing (and appending) 
 *     capabilities. On reading, the segment layout is inconsequential, and a
 *     logical partitioning across threads is used.)
 *
 * Each segment file internally then has the following layout
 *  (1) Consecutive Block contents, each block 4K aligned.
 *  (2) A direct serialization of a vector<vector<block_info> > (blocks[column_id][block_id])
 *  (3) 8 bytes containing the file offset. at which (2) begins
 *
 * For instance, if there are 2 segments with 3 columns each of 20 rows, 
 * we may get the following layout: 
 *
 * group.0001:
 *   - column 0, block 0, 3 rows
 *   - column 1, block 0, 3 rows
 *   - column 2, block 0, 4 rows
 *   - column 0, block 1, 4 rows
 *   - column 0, block 2, 3 rows
 *   - column 1, block 1, 7 rows
 *   - column 2, block 1, 6 rows
 *
 * group.0002:
 *   - column 1, block 0, 5 rows
 *   - column 0, block 0, 10 rows
 *   - column 1, block 1, 5 rows
 *   - column 2, block 0, 10 rows
 *
 * Observe the following:
 *  1) Each segment contains the same number 
 *     of rows from each column. (technically the format does not require 
 *     this, but the writer will always produce this result)
 *  2) Blocks can be of different sizes. (the block_manager and block_writer
 *     do not have a block size constraint. The \ref sarray_group_format_writer_v2
 *     tries to keep to a block size of SFRAME_DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE 
 *     after compression, but this is done by performing block size estimation
 *     (#bytes written / #rows written). But the format itself does not care. 
 *  3) Blocks can be laid out in arbitrary order across columns. Striping of 
 *     columns is unnecessary)
 *  4) Within each segment, the blocks for a given column are consecutive.
 * 
 * File Addressing
 * ---------------
 * Since an array group (and hence a segment) can contain multiple columns, 
 * we need a uniform way of addressing a particular column inside an array 
 * group, or inside a segment. Thus the following convention is used:
 *
 * Given an array group of 3 columns comprising of the files:
 *  - group.sidx
 *  - group.0000, group.0001, group.0002, group.0003
 *
 * Column 0 in the array group can be addressed by opening the index file
 * "group.sidx:0". Similarly, column 2 can be addressed using "group.sidx:2"
 *
 * Column 2 of the array group thus has the segment files:
 *  - group.0000:2, group.0001:2, group.0002:2, group.0002:3
 *
 * By convention if "group.sidx" is opened as a single array, it refers to 
 * column 0.
 * 
 * Block Manager
 * -------------
 * The block manager is a singleton reader object that provides read access
 * to columns. The usage convention is:
 *  - block_manager& manager = block_manager::get_instance()
 *  - column_address = manager.open_column("group.0000:2") // opens column 2 in segment
 *  - .. do stuff ..
 *  - manager.close_column(column_address)
 * We will expand on .. do stuff .. below.
 *
 * The reason for having a singleton block manager is to provide better control
 * over file handle utilization. Specifically, the block manager maintains a 
 * pool of file handles and will recycle file handles (close them until they 
 * are next needed, then reopen and seek) so as to avoid file handle usage 
 * exceeding a certain limit (as defined in DEFAULT_FILE_HANDLE_POOL_SIZE)
 * Furthermore, the block manager can combine accesses of multiple columns in the
 * same array group into a single file handle. Future performance improvements
 * involving better IO scheduling can also be performed here.
 * 
 * When a column is opened by \ref open_column(), a \ref column_address is 
 * returned. This is a pair of integers of {segment_file_id, and column_id}.
 * column_id is the column within the segment. For instance, opening "group.0000:2"
 * will have column_id = 2. The segment_file_id is an internal ID assigned by
 * the block manager to track all accesses to the file group.0000. All open calls
 * to group.0000 will return the same segment_file_id, and a reference counter
 * is used internally to figure out when the file handle and block metadata 
 * can be released. \ref close_column() thus must be called for every call
 * to \ref open_column().
 *
 * Once the column is opened, \ref num_blocks_in_column() can be used to obtain
 * the number of blocks in the segment file belonging to the column. 
 * \ref read_block() or \ref read_typed_block() can then be used to read the
 * blocks. These functions take a \ref block_address, which is a triple of 
 * {segment_file_id, column_id, block_id}. The first 2 fields can be copied
 * from the column_address, the block_id is a sequential counter from 0 to
 * \ref num_blocks_in_column() - 1.
 *
