/**
 * Base class for all authentication method implementations.
 *
 * The class implements a few basic functions to attach and validate messages
 * sent between the client and the server. Messages sent from the client to
 * the server are \ref call_message objects. Messages sent from the server
 *  to the client (in response to a call message) are \ref reply_message 
 *  objects.
 *
 * \ref authentication_base::apply_auth(call_message& msg) is called on the 
 * client side to attach authentication information to the message. When the
 * server receives the message, 
 * \ref authentication_base::validate_auth(call_message& msg) is called on the
 * server side to validate the message. If this function returns false, the
 * server discards the message.
 * The server then replies with a \ref reply_message and the function 
 * \ref authentication_base::apply_auth(reply_message& msg) is called on the 
 * server side to attach authentication information to the message. When the
 * client receives the message, 
 * \ref authentication_base::validate_auth(reply_message& msg) is called on the
 * client side to validate the message. If this function returns false, the
 * function call is marked as failed.
 *
 * All of the implemented functions must be reentrant, and must not assume 
 * synchronicity. (i.e. apply_auth can be called on the client side many
 * times in succession).
 *
 * Finally, authentication methods should be designed to be "stackable" with 
 * other authentication methods. i.e. I should be able to apply two different
 * types of authentication methods on top of each other.
