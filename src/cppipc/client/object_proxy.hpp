/**
 * \ingroup cppipc
 * Refers to a remote object and allows function calls to be issued
 * across a communication link.
 *
 * The object_proxy object internally maintains an object ID which identifies
 * an object on the other side of a communication link established by the 
 * comm_client. The object_proxy is templatized over a type T which must have
 * an identical object interface as the remote object. T must also provide the 
 * registration callbacks which match the registration callbacks on the remote 
 * end. For that reason, it is easiest if T defines an interface and implements
 * the register callbacks. And the remote object then inherits from T.
 *
 * The recommended pattern is as follows:
 * Given the following base class with an implementation on the server side
 *
 * \code
 * class object_base {
 *  public:
 *   virtual ~object_base() { }
 *   virtual int add(int, int) = 0;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * We implement a proxy object which has the object_proxy as a member, and 
 * inherits from the object_base. Each function call is then forwarded to
 * the remote machine.
 *
 * \code
 * class object_proxy: public object_base {
 *  public:
 *   cppipc::object_proxy<object_base> proxy;
 *
 *   // proxy must be provided with the comm_client object on construction
 *   test_object_proxy(cppipc::comm_client& comm):proxy(comm){ } 
 *
 *   int add(int a, int b) {
 *     // forward the call to the remote machine
 *     return proxy.call(&object_base::add,a, b);
 *   }
 * };
 * \endcode
