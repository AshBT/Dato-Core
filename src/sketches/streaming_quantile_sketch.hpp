/**
 * This class implements the *streaming* quantile sketching datastructure as
 * described in Qi Zhang and Wei Wang. A Fast Algorithm for Approximate
 * Quantiles in High Speed Data Streams. SSDBM 2007.
 *
 * This sketch is basically a streaming version of the \ref quantile_sketch
 *
 * It constructs a low memory sketch from a stream of unknown length.
 * To summarize the basic idea, it draws samples from the stream and maintains
 * for each sample a lower bound and an upper bound on its rank in the stream.
 *
 * Usage:
 * \code
 * // construct a sketch at a particular accuracy
 * quantile_sketch<double> sketch(0.01);
 * ...
 * insert any number elements into the sketch
 * sketch.add(value)
 * ...
 * sketch.finalize() // finalize must be called before queries can be made
 * \endcode
 *
 * To query, two family of functions are provided.
 *
 * The regular query functions take linear time in the size of the sketch, and
 * have accuracy guarantees
 * \code
 * sketch.query(rank) // rank is between [0, N-1]
 * sketch.query_quantile(quantile) // quantile is between [0, 1.0]
 * \endcode
 *
 * The fast query functions take logarithmic time in the size of the sketch,
 * and have no accuracy guarantees.
 * \code
 * sketch.fast_query(rank) // rank is between [0, N-1]
 * sketch.fast_query_quantile(quantile) // quantile is between [0, 1.0]
 * \endcode
 *
 * The sketch structure also support parallel sketching:
 *
 * Example:
 * If I have 16 data streams, I can construct 16 streaming_quantile_sketches:
 *
 * Each sketch can then be ran on each data stream independently.
 * Then all can be combined into one. Note that the process for doing this on
 * the streaming_quantile_sketch is somewhat more complicated. It involves a
 * partial finalization of each substream (\ref sub_stream_finalize() ), before
 * combining. And after combining, a different finalization call must be made
 * (\ref combine_finalize())
 *
 * \code
 * // add stuff to each sub stream
 * for each sub-stream sketch:
 *   sub-stream-sketch.add(...)
 *
 * // pre-finalize each sub stream
 * for each sub-stream sketch:
 *   sub-stream-sketch.substream_finalize();
 *
 * // combine into one sketch
 * quantile_sketch sketch(0.01)
 * for each sub-stream sketch:
 *   sketch.combine(sub-stream-sketch)
 *
 * // finalize the main sketch
 * sketch.combine_finalize()
 * \endcode
 *
 * \tparam Type to contain in the sketch. type must be less-than-comparable,
 * constructible, copy constructible, assignable.
 *
 * Technical Details
 * -----------------
 * We create a sequence of fixed length sketches, with each subsequent sketch
 * sized to sketch twice the amount of data as the previous one.
 * Each sketch is built to have a final finalized error of \epsilon / 3.
 *
 * If no sub-streams are used, the finalize() phase will merge all sketches
 * and recompress to introduce an additional error of (2 * \epsilon / 3)
 *
 * If sub-streams are used, the sub-stream finalize will merge all the
 * sub-stream sketches to introduce an additional error of (\epsilon / 3).
 * Then each of the substream sketches are merged into the final sketch and
 * compressed again to introduce an additional error of (\epsilon / 3)
 *
